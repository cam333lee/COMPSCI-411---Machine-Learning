#Assignment 1 Tasks:

1. Separately on each dataset, vary value of the min_samples_leaf parameter and measure training and test roc_auc scores on 10-fold cross-validation. Do this from inside the program. Plot the results on a graph with the parameter on the x-axis. Point out the regions of overfitting and underfitting on this graph. The graph will be between min_samples_leaf parameter on the x-axis and mean roc_auc score (of the 10 folds) on the y-axis.

2. Separately on each dataset, use GridSearchCV to search for the best parameter and generate the results of 10-fold cross-validation. Show the results, i.e. the mean roc_auc score (of the 10-folds) for each dataset, in a graph or a table. Also point out the best parameter value for the entire dataset.

3. Write a written report on the findings.
